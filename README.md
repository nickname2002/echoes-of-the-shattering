# Echoes of the Shattering

**Echoes of the Shattering** is a single-player, turn-based card battle game that emphasizes **strategic decision-making, build customization, and player experimentation**. The game draws inspiration from the mechanics and atmosphere of *Elden Ring*, translating its depth and challenge into a card-based combat system.  

As such, the game takes place in **The Lands Between**, allowing you to battle **friends and foes** from the legendary action-adventure RPG. Players will manage **stamina, buffs, shields, and healing** while utilizing an ever-evolving **deck of cards** that define their playstyle. The game encourages adaptability, rewarding players for crafting **unique builds** without penalizing experimentation.
